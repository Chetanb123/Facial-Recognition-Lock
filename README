3) Run test.py to ensure that the model can detect a face
4) Run generatekey.py to create a key used to decrypt the file
5) Create a file of your choosing and store in the same directory as test.py
6) Run the encrypt.py and input the file name that you created, this will replace the original file as a .encrypted
7) Finally run test.py and it will create the decrypted version of the file in the directory
